# Arcade-Pong
The classic arcade Pong game but with gesture controls. Built with OpenCV and Mediapipe.

## Setup 
The game is built and tested on python 3.9.6 and hence, I recommend that you use the same version of python to run it.

Create a virtual environment and use pip to install the following libraries required for the game to run
- OpenCV
```
pip install opencv-python==4.10.0.82
```
- Mediapipe
```
pip install mediapipe==0.10.14
```
- Numpy
```
pip install numpy==1.26.4
```
## Play the game
Currently, only a prototype of the game is available with limited features. You can try it out and give me constructive feedback that I can implement in the actual release version of the game.

To run the prototype version of the game follow the steps below:
- Open the prototype directory `Arcade-Pong/prototype`
- Run the `game.py` script present inside the directory
- To quit the game just press the `'q' key`

## Contribute
I am quite new to OpenCV and am still learning by building projects like Arcade-Pong. I would be more than happy to receive your help and support to make my skills and this project better. The only favor I ask you is to just drop in your feedback or comments in the [Issues section](https://github.com/NitishKanna107/Arcade-Pong/issues).

Thank you very much for stopping by this repository and I hope you learnt something useful from my project.
